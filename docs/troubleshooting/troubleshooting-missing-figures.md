# Troubleshooting: Missing Figure Files

## Problem: PDF Generation Fails Due to Missing Figure Files

### Symptoms
- `make pdf` fails with validation errors
- Error messages like: "Figure file not found: FIGURES/SFigure__arxiv_growth/SFigure__arxiv_growth.png"
- The validation shows missing figure files (PNG, PDF, SVG) in MANUSCRIPT/FIGURES/ subdirectories

### Root Cause
The repository tracks generated figure files alongside their generation scripts (Python, R, Mermaid). If these figure files are accidentally deleted (e.g., by `make clean`, manual deletion, or git operations), the build process will fail because the LaTeX compilation expects these files to exist.

## âœ… Automatic Solution (Recommended)

**As of the latest version, `make pdf` automatically detects and runs all figure generation scripts!**

Simply run:
```bash
make pdf
```

The build system will:
1. **Auto-detect missing figures** - Check if output files exist for each generation script
2. **Execute figure generation scripts** - Automatically run `SFigure__arxiv_growth.py`, `SFigure__preprint_trends.R`, Mermaid diagrams, etc.
3. **Generate missing files** - Create PNG, PDF, and SVG versions as appropriate
4. **Continue with PDF build** - Proceed with LaTeX compilation

### Manual Solution (If Needed)
If you need to regenerate figures manually:

```bash
# Navigate to the FIGURES directory
cd MANUSCRIPT/FIGURES

# Activate the virtual environment
source ../../.venv/bin/activate

# Run the figure generation scripts
python SFigure__arxiv_growth.py
Rscript SFigure__preprint_trends.R

# Generate Mermaid diagrams (automatically handled by rxiv)
# Mermaid diagrams are now generated automatically via mermaid.ink API

# Return to project root and test the build
cd ../..
make pdf
```

### Advanced Figure Generation
For more control, you can use the dedicated figure generation command:

```bash
# Generate all figures automatically (Mermaid + Python)
source .venv/bin/activate
rxiv figures --figures-dir MANUSCRIPT/FIGURES --verbose

# Force regenerate all figures even if they exist
make pdf FORCE_FIGURES=true
```

### How It Works
The enhanced build system automatically:
- **Detects figure generation scripts** (`.py`, `.R`, `.mmd` files) in the FIGURES directory
- **Checks for corresponding outputs** (PNG, PDF, and SVG files in subdirectories)
- **Runs missing scripts** using the project's Python environment and R installation
- **Handles multiple formats**: Python scripts, R scripts, and Mermaid diagrams

### Prevention
- The `make clean` command removes generated figures, but `make pdf` will automatically regenerate them
- When cloning the repository, missing figures will be auto-generated on first build
- The build process is now robust against missing figure files

### Why Generated Files Are Still Tracked
Even with automatic generation, generated figure files (PNG, PDF, SVG) remain tracked in git because:
- They ensure reproducible builds across different environments
- Not all users have Python/R dependencies needed for figure generation
- They provide immediate availability without requiring script execution
- They serve as fallbacks when figure generation environments differ
- They guarantee consistent output across different versions of plotting libraries

### Figure Positioning and Layout Problems
After resolving missing figure files, you might encounter figure positioning, spacing, or layout issues in your PDF. For comprehensive guidance on controlling figure placement and resolving positioning problems, see the **[Figure Positioning Guide](../tutorials/figure-positioning.md)**.

Common positioning issues include:
- Figures appearing on wrong pages
- Poor spacing between figures and text
- Panel reference formatting problems
- Full-width figure layout issues
