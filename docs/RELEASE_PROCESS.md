This document outlines the complete release process for rxiv-maker, including automated workflows, package manager updates, and manual steps.

## Overview

The rxiv-maker project uses a comprehensive release pipeline that includes:
- Automated testing across multiple platforms

- PyPI package publishing
- Homebrew formula updates
- Scoop package updates
- GitHub releases with artifacts

## Release Types

### Patch Releases (v1.4.x)
- Bug fixes
- Minor documentation updates
- Performance improvements
- No breaking changes

### Minor Releases (v1.x.0)
- New features
- Non-breaking API additions
- Significant improvements
- Deprecation warnings

### Major Releases (v2.0.0)
- Breaking changes
- Major feature overhauls
- API redesigns
- Requires migration guide

## Automated Release Process

### 1. Trigger Release Workflow

The release process is triggered by pushing a git tag:

```bash
# Create and push a new tag
git tag v1.4.8
git push origin v1.4.8
```

### Track Changes PDF Generation

For tag-triggered releases, the system automatically generates a track changes PDF for the EXAMPLE_MANUSCRIPT showing differences since the last major version:

- **Automatic Detection**: Identifies the previous major version (e.g., v1.3.0 when releasing v1.4.2)
- **File Naming**: Uses format `{year}__{authors}_et_al__changes_vs_{version}.pdf`
- **LaTeX Diff**: Employs `latexdiff` to highlight additions (blue underlined) and deletions (red strikethrough)
- **Release Integration**: Automatically includes track changes PDF in release assets and notes

Or manually via GitHub Actions workflow dispatch:
- Go to Actions → Release and Binary Distribution
- Click "Run workflow"
- Enter the tag (e.g., `v1.4.8`)

### 2. Automated Pipeline Steps

The release pipeline automatically:

1. **Comprehensive Testing**
   - Runs full test suite on Ubuntu, Windows, macOS
   - Tests Python 3.11 and 3.12
   - Validates all execution engines (local, Docker, Podman)

2. **Binary Distribution**
   - Creates standalone binaries using PyInstaller
   - Builds for Linux x64, Windows x64, macOS x64/ARM64
   - Optimizes binaries with UPX compression
   - Uploads artifacts to GitHub release

3. **GitHub Release Creation**
   - Creates release notes from CHANGELOG.md
   - Attaches binary artifacts and PDFs (including track changes)
   - Marks as pre-release or stable based on version

## Package Manager Updates

### PyPI Publishing

**Automated via GitHub Actions:**
- Uses trusted publishing (no API tokens required)
- Builds source and wheel distributions
- Publishes to PyPI on successful release

**Manual Publishing (if needed):**
```bash
# Build distributions
uv build

# Upload to PyPI (requires API token)
uv publish
```

### Homebrew Formula Updates

**Location:** `submodules/homebrew-rxiv-maker/Formula/rxiv-maker.rb`

**Automated Process:**
1. Release orchestrator triggers Homebrew update workflow
2. Formula template is updated with new version and SHA256
3. Pull request is created to `homebrew-rxiv-maker` repository
4. CI validates the formula
5. Formula is published after validation

**Manual Update (if needed):**
```bash
# Update Homebrew formula
cd submodules/homebrew-rxiv-maker
./scripts/update-formula.sh v1.4.8

# Test formula locally
brew install --build-from-source ./Formula/rxiv-maker.rb
brew test rxiv-maker
```

### Scoop Package Updates

**Location:** `submodules/scoop-rxiv-maker/bucket/rxiv-maker.json`

**Automated Process:**
1. Scoop manifest is updated with new version and URLs
2. SHA256 hashes are fetched for Windows binaries
3. Manifest is validated against Scoop standards
4. Updated manifest is published

**Manual Update (if needed):**
```bash
# Update Scoop manifest
cd submodules/scoop-rxiv-maker
./scripts/update-manifest.ps1 -Version v1.4.8

# Test manifest locally (Windows)
scoop install .\bucket\rxiv-maker.json
scoop test rxiv-maker
```

## Version Management

### Version File
Update version in `src/rxiv_maker/__version__.py`:
```python
__version__ = "1.4.8"
```

### Version Detection
The release workflow automatically detects version from:
1. Git tag (preferred): `v1.4.8`
2. Version file: `src/rxiv_maker/__version__.py`
3. pyproject.toml (dynamic versioning)

## Troubleshooting Release Issues

### Failed Binary Builds
- Check PyInstaller compatibility with new dependencies
- Verify UPX compression works on all platforms
- Review build logs in GitHub Actions

### Package Manager Update Failures
- **Homebrew**: Check formula syntax and dependency changes
- **Scoop**: Verify JSON manifest structure and URLs
- **PyPI**: Ensure wheel builds correctly on all platforms

### Release Rollback
If a release has critical issues:

1. **Remove from PyPI** (if possible within 72 hours)
2. **Revert Homebrew formula** to previous version
3. **Update Scoop manifest** to previous version
4. **Mark GitHub release** as pre-release
5. **Create hotfix release** with fixes

## Manual Release Steps (Emergency)

If automated systems fail, manual release can be performed:

### 1. Build and Test Locally
```bash
# Run full test suite
nox -s tests

# Build package
uv build

# Test installation
pip install dist/rxiv_maker-*.whl
```

### 2. Upload to PyPI
```bash
# Upload to PyPI
uv publish
```

### 3. Create GitHub Release
- Go to GitHub → Releases → Create a new release
- Add tag and release notes
- Upload binary artifacts manually

### 4. Update Package Managers
```bash
# Update Homebrew
cd submodules/homebrew-rxiv-maker
./scripts/update-formula.sh v1.4.8

# Update Scoop (Windows)
cd submodules/scoop-rxiv-maker
./scripts/update-manifest.ps1 -Version v1.4.8
```

## Release Monitoring

### Automated Monitoring
The release orchestrator monitors:
- Package manager update status
- Installation success rates
- User reports and issues

### Manual Verification
After each release, verify:
- Installation from all package managers
- Basic functionality tests
- Documentation accessibility
- No broken links or references

## Contact and Support
