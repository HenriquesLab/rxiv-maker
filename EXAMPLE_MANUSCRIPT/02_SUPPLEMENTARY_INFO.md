## Supplementary Notes

{#snote:figure-generation} **Programmatic Figure Generation and Computational Reproducibility**

Rxiv-Maker's figure generation capabilities demonstrate automated processing pipelines maintaining transparent connections between source data and final visualisations whilst ensuring computational reproducibility. The system supports two primary methodologies: Mermaid diagram processing and Python/R-based data visualisation, each addressing distinct requirements within scientific publishing workflows.

Mermaid diagram processing leverages the Mermaid CLI to convert text-based specifications into publication-ready graphics. This approach enables version-controlled diagram creation where complex flowcharts, system architectures, and conceptual models are specified using intuitive syntax and automatically rendered into multiple output formats. The system generates SVG, PNG, and PDF variants accommodating different compilation requirements whilst maintaining vector quality. This automation eliminates manual effort for diagram creation and updates, ensuring modifications are immediately reflected in the final document.

Script-based figure generation represents computational reproducibility where analytical scripts execute during compilation to generate figures directly from source data. This integration ensures visualisations remain synchronised with underlying datasets and analytical methods, eliminating outdated or inconsistent graphics. The system executes image generation scripts within the compilation environment, automatically detecting generated files and incorporating them into document structure. This approach transforms figures from static illustrations into dynamic, reproducible computational artefacts enhancing scientific rigour.

{#snote:mathematical-formulas} **Mathematical Formula Support and LaTeX Integration**

Rxiv-Maker integrates mathematical notation by translating markdown-style expressions into publication-ready LaTeX mathematics. This enables researchers to author complex mathematical content using familiar syntax whilst benefiting from LaTeX's superior typesetting capabilities.

Inline mathematical expressions use dollar sign delimiters (`$...$`), enabling formulas such as $E = mc^2$ or $\alpha = \frac{\beta}{\gamma}$ to be embedded within text. The conversion system preserves expressions during markdown-to-LaTeX transformation, ensuring mathematical notation maintains proper formatting and spacing.

Display equations utilise double dollar delimiters (`$$...$$`) for prominent mathematical expressions requiring centred presentation. Complex equations such as the Schr√∂dinger equation:

$$i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Psi(\mathbf{r},t) = \hat{H}\Psi(\mathbf{r},t)$$

or the Navier-Stokes equations:

$$\rho\left(\frac{\partial \mathbf{v}}{\partial t} + \mathbf{v} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{v}\right) = -\nabla p + \mu \nabla^2 \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{f}$$

demonstrate the framework's capability to handle sophisticated mathematical typography, including Greek letters, partial derivatives, vector notation, and complex fraction structures.

The system supports LaTeX's mathematical environments by directly including LaTeX code blocks. This hybrid approach enables simple markdown syntax for straightforward expressions whilst retaining access to LaTeX's full capabilities for complex multi-line derivations.

Mathematical expressions within figure captions, table entries, and cross-references are automatically processed, ensuring consistent typography throughout documents. The framework's content protection system preserves mathematical expressions during multi-stage conversion, preventing unwanted modifications.

Statistical notation commonly required in manuscripts is supported, including confidence intervals $\mu \pm \sigma$, probability distributions $P(X \leq x)$, and significance levels $p < 0.05$. Complex expressions involving summations $\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i$, integrals $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) dx$, and matrix operations $\mathbf{A}^{-1}\mathbf{b} = \mathbf{x}$ are rendered with appropriate spacing.

{#snote:caching-validation} **Intelligent Caching and Validation Systems**

Rxiv-Maker implements sophisticated caching mechanisms that significantly accelerate manuscript compilation through content-based change detection and selective regeneration. The caching system operates at multiple levels: file-level checksums track modifications to source documents, whilst content-based hashing monitors changes within executable code blocks and figure generation scripts.

The figure caching system maintains checksums for Python, R, and Mermaid source files, comparing current content against cached versions to determine whether regeneration is necessary. This approach eliminates redundant computation whilst ensuring figures remain synchronised with their source code. Cache invalidation occurs automatically when dependencies change, maintaining consistency without manual intervention.

The comprehensive validation framework provides multi-layered quality assurance through LaTeX error parsing with contextual error messages, figure validation that verifies file existence and format compatibility, and citation validation with DOI resolution through CrossRef and DataCite APIs. The system generates detailed diagnostic reports that guide users through error resolution, significantly reducing debugging complexity.

Dependency validation ensures all required components (LaTeX distributions, Python packages, R libraries, Node.js modules) are properly installed and configured before manuscript processing begins. The validation system provides automated installation suggestions for missing dependencies, streamlining setup procedures across different computing environments.

{#snote:latex-injection} **Direct LaTeX Integration and Advanced Typesetting**

While Rxiv-Maker's markdown-to-LaTeX conversion handles the majority of scientific publishing requirements, the framework provides direct LaTeX injection capabilities through `{{tex: ...}}` blocks for sophisticated typesetting scenarios that exceed markdown's capabilities. This approach offers researchers an "escape hatch" to access LaTeX's full typesetting power when needed, while maintaining the simplicity of markdown for routine content.

Direct LaTeX injection is particularly valuable for complex tables with custom formatting, advanced mathematical layouts, specialized scientific notation, and publication-quality data presentation that requires precise control over spacing, alignment, and typography. The following example demonstrates a measurement data table utilizing LaTeX's professional table formatting capabilities:

{{tex:
\begin{stable}[h!]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|r|}
\hline
\textbf{Sample} & \textbf{Temperature} & \textbf{Pressure} & \textbf{Yield} \\
 & \textbf{(K)} & \textbf{(MPa)} & \textbf{(\%)} \\
\hline
Control & $298.15 \pm 0.05$ & $0.101 \pm 0.001$ & $85.3 \pm 2.1$ \\
Sample A & $373.15 \pm 0.10$ & $0.250 \pm 0.005$ & $92.7 \pm 1.8$ \\
Sample B & $423.15 \pm 0.15$ & $0.500 \pm 0.010$ & $96.1 \pm 1.4$ \\
Sample C & $473.15 \pm 0.20$ & $1.000 \pm 0.020$ & $88.9 \pm 2.3$ \\
\hline
\multicolumn{3}{|l|}{Mean $\pm$ Standard Deviation} & $90.8 \pm 4.5$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{\textbf{Example Measurement Results with Statistical Analysis.} The data shown is purely illustrative and does not represent actual experimental results.}
\label{stable:experimental-results}
\end{stable}
}}

This example showcases LaTeX features including professional table borders (`\hline`), custom column alignment specifications (`|l|c|c|r|`), multi-column headers, mathematical expressions with proper spacing, and scientific notation with uncertainties. Such precise formatting control enables researchers to meet the exacting typographical standards required for high-impact scientific publications while maintaining computational reproducibility through the framework's local execution environment.
