## Supplementary Notes

{#snote:getting_started} **A Getting Started Tutorial**

To help new users begin with Rxiv-Maker, this tutorial provides a simple walkthrough for creating a minimal manuscript. The process starts with initialising a new project, which sets up the necessary directory structure and configuration files.

First, open a terminal and run the command `rxiv init my_new_paper`. This creates a new directory named `my_new_paper` containing the essential files: `00_CONFIG.yml` for manuscript metadata, `01_MAIN.md` for the main text, `02_SUPPLEMENTARY_INFO.md` for supplementary content, and `03_REFERENCES.bib` for the bibliography. The system also creates subdirectories for `FIGURES` and `DATA`.

Next, you can edit the `01_MAIN.md` file to add your text. You can use standard Markdown for formatting, such as `#` for headings and `*` for italics. To add a citation, simply use the `@key` syntax, where `key` corresponds to an entry in your `.bib` file. For example, to cite the original literate programming paper, you would write `[@Knuth1984_literate_programming]`.

To build the PDF, navigate into the project directory (`cd my_new_paper`) and run the command `rxiv pdf`. The framework will process your files, execute any embedded code, and generate a professionally typeset PDF in the `output` directory. If you encounter any issues, running `rxiv validate` provides a detailed check of your manuscript's integrity, flagging common problems like missing figures or broken citations.

This straightforward process allows you to get from a blank slate to a compiled PDF in minutes, providing a solid foundation that you can then build upon with more advanced features like programmatic figures and tables.

{#snote:markdown-syntax} **Rxiv-Maker Markdown Syntax and Advanced LaTeX Integration**

This comprehensive reference demonstrates the automated translation system that enables researchers to write in familiar markdown syntax whilst producing professional LaTeX output. The table below showcases both the standard Markdown-to-LaTeX translations and serves as a perfect example of Rxiv-Maker's `{{tex:...}}` blocks, which allow direct LaTeX injection for advanced formatting needs.

For complex table structures that require precise control over formatting, multi-column headers, or mathematical notation, Rxiv-Maker's `{{tex:...}}` syntax provides full access to LaTeX's typesetting capabilities. This table itself was created using `{{tex:...}}` blocks, demonstrating how raw LaTeX can be seamlessly integrated into Markdown documents while maintaining the tex block protection system that prevents markdown processing of LaTeX-specific syntax.

{#snote:programmatic_figures} **Programmatic Figure Generation**

Rxiv-Maker's figure generation capabilities are designed to ensure a transparent and reproducible connection between your data and your final visualisations. The system supports two main approaches for creating figures programmatically: script-based generation using Python or R, and diagram rendering from text-based descriptions using Mermaid.

For script-based figures, you place your `.py` or `.R` scripts in the `FIGURES` directory. These scripts often leverage powerful plotting libraries such as Matplotlib [@Hunter2007_matplotlib] or Seaborn [@Waskom2021_seaborn]. During compilation, Rxiv-Maker executes these scripts, and any image files they save (e.g., PNG, PDF, SVG) are automatically detected and can be included in your manuscript. This ensures your visualisations are always synchronised with the underlying data and analysis, as a change in one will trigger the regeneration of the other. This is the method used to produce @sfig:arxiv_growth and @sfig:preprint_trends.

For diagrams, such as flowcharts or system architectures, you can use Mermaid [@Mermaid2023_documentation]. You create a `.mmd` file containing a text-based description of your diagram. The framework uses the Mermaid command-line tool to render this description into a vector or raster image. This allows your diagrams to be version-controlled just like code, making them easy to modify and track over time.

{#snote:mathematical_formulas} **Mathematical Formula Support**

Rxiv-Maker seamlessly integrates mathematical notation by translating Markdown-style expressions into high-quality LaTeX mathematics. This allows you to write complex mathematical content using simple, familiar syntax.

For inline mathematics, you can use single dollar sign delimiters (`$...$`), allowing formulas like $E = mc^2$ to be embedded directly within your text. For larger, display-style equations, you can use double dollar signs (`$$...$$`) to centre the expression on its own line. For example:

$$
i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Psi(\mathbf{r},t) = \hat{H}\Psi(\mathbf{r},t)
$$

The framework's multi-pass translator is designed to protect these mathematical expressions, ensuring they are not accidentally altered during the conversion from Markdown to LaTeX. This robust system supports a wide range of mathematical and statistical notation, from simple symbols to complex multi-line equations, ensuring your quantitative work is always presented clearly and professionally.

{#snote:caching_validation} **Intelligent Caching and Validation**

To accelerate compilation, Rxiv-Maker uses an intelligent caching system that avoids redundant work. It operates by generating a checksum—a unique digital signature—for each figure's dependencies, including the source script and any input data files. A figure is only regenerated if this checksum changes, meaning you can recompile your manuscript rapidly during writing, as only the modified components are rebuilt. This saves considerable time without sacrificing the reproducibility of the final document.

Complementing this is a powerful validation framework that acts as a quality-control mechanism. Running `rxiv validate` performs a multi-level check of your manuscript. Before compilation, it looks for missing figure files, broken cross-references, and malformed bibliography entries. During compilation, it parses LaTeX logs to provide clear, understandable error messages. After compilation, it even performs a lightweight scan of the PDF to flag potential rendering issues. This ensures your manuscript is technically sound at every stage.
