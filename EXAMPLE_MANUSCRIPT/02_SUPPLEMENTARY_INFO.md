## Supplementary Notes

{#snote:figure-generation} **Programmatic Figure Generation and Computational Reproducibility**

The technical architecture underlying Rxiv-Maker's figure generation capabilities demonstrates how automated processing pipelines can maintain transparent connections between source data and final visualisations whilst ensuring computational reproducibility. The system supports two primary methodologies for figure creation: Mermaid diagram processing and Python and R-based data visualisation, each addressing distinct requirements within the scientific publishing workflow.

Mermaid diagram processing leverages the Mermaid CLI to convert text-based diagram specifications into publication-ready graphics. This approach enables version-controlled diagram creation where complex flowcharts, system architectures, and conceptual models can be specified using intuitive syntax and automatically rendered into multiple output formats. The system generates SVG, PNG, and PDF variants to accommodate different compilation requirements whilst maintaining vector quality where appropriate. This automation eliminates the manual effort traditionally required for diagram creation and updates, whilst ensuring that modifications to diagram specifications are immediately reflected in the final document.

Script-based figure generation (Python and R) represents a more sophisticated approach to computational reproducibility, where analytical scripts are executed during document compilation to generate figures directly from source data. This integration ensures that visualisations remain synchronised with the underlying datasets and analytical methods, eliminating the possibility of outdated or inconsistent graphics persisting in the manuscript. The system executes the image generation scripts within the compilation environment, automatically detecting generated image files and incorporating them into the document structure. This approach transforms figures from static illustrations into dynamic, reproducible computational artefacts that enhance the scientific rigour of the publication.

{#snote:mathematical-formulas} **Mathematical Formula Support and LaTeX Integration**

The Rxiv-Maker framework seamlessly integrates mathematical notation by automatically translating markdown-style mathematical expressions into publication-ready LaTeX mathematics. This capability enables researchers to author complex mathematical content using familiar syntax whilst benefiting from LaTeX's superior mathematical typesetting capabilities.

Inline mathematical expressions are supported through dollar sign delimiters (`$...$`), enabling simple formulas such as $E = mc^2$ or $\alpha = \frac{\beta}{\gamma}$ to be embedded within narrative text. The conversion system automatically preserves these expressions during the markdown-to-LaTeX transformation, ensuring that mathematical notation maintains proper formatting and spacing according to established typographical conventions.

Display equations utilise double dollar sign delimiters (`$$...$$`) for prominent mathematical expressions that require centered presentation. Complex equations such as the Schr√∂dinger equation:

$$i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Psi(\mathbf{r},t) = \hat{H}\Psi(\mathbf{r},t)$$

or the Navier-Stokes equations:

$$\rho\left(\frac{\partial \mathbf{v}}{\partial t} + \mathbf{v} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{v}\right) = -\nabla p + \mu \nabla^2 \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{f}$$

demonstrate the framework's capability to handle sophisticated mathematical typography, including Greek letters, partial derivatives, vector notation, and complex fraction structures.

The system also supports LaTeX's advanced mathematical environments by directly including LaTeX code blocks. This hybrid approach enables authors to utilise simple markdown syntax for straightforward expressions whilst retaining access to LaTeX's full mathematical typesetting capabilities for complex multi-line derivations:

The framework supports Maxwell's equations and complex mathematical expressions in various formats for flexible scientific notation.

Mathematical expressions within figure captions, table entries, and cross-references are automatically processed, ensuring consistent mathematical typography throughout the document. The framework's content protection system ensures that mathematical expressions are preserved during the multi-stage conversion pipeline, preventing unwanted modifications to delicate mathematical syntax.

Statistical notation commonly required in scientific manuscripts is fully supported, including confidence intervals $\mu \pm \sigma$, probability distributions $P(X \leq x)$, and statistical tests with significance levels $p < 0.05$. Complex expressions involving summations $\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i$, integrals $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) dx$, and matrix operations $\mathbf{A}^{-1}\mathbf{b} = \mathbf{x}$ are rendered with appropriate spacing and sizing.
